# a2560k-games
I got my start with computers in the early 1980's.

An influential book at the time for me was the book [Basic Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games) by David Ahl.

In 2021 Jeff Atwood commenced a projet to convert the classic games in this book to modern languages without changing and functionality i.e. leaving the games pretty much as they were.

I ported quite a number of the basic games to Java and they are currently in Jeff's [Basic-Computer-Games](https://github.com/journich/basic-computer-games) repository on Github.

Recently I've taken an interest in the [c256Foenix](https://c256foenix.com/) series of computers, specifically the [a2560K(https://c256foenix.com/products/#a2560k).

This is a new look at retro machines, with specifications like a 32 bit Motorola MC68040V CPU (68000 series), 64 Mb (not GB!) of ram, and other features appropriate for the 1980's and 1990's.

The machines are designed and built by the very talented Stefany Alliare.

The thing is these computers go back to a day where Windows or Mac OS did not exist, where a machine booted up immediately without an OS and definately did not hold your hand.

I've now decided to convert my Java ported games to C that themselves were ported from Basic, so that they can execute on the A2560K.

I hope you enjoy!
